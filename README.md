# FLIGHT FARE PREDICTION

An ML Model which predicts the flight fare with an accuracy of 81.23% .


## AIM :

To build a model which will predict the correct Flight Fare for any journey using Machine Learning technique.
## MOTIVATION:

We have often heard people around saying Flight Ticket are often very unpredictable and are very hard to guess. If one might see a price today and checks the same flight price tomorrow its a whole different story by then.

## WHAT IS TO BE DONE ? 

Create an ML Model which will help in predicting the prices of a flight in giving the jouney details.
The model is trained by the provided prices of the flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities. 
## TIMELINE OF THE PROJECT :

#### 1. DATA ANALYSIS
       * Load the dataset 
       * Finding out different relation between the attributes
       

#### 2. FEATURE ENGINEERING
       * Doing various operations on data
       * Handle the missing values 
       * Remove the outliers and related attributes
       * Accordingly perform OneHotEncoding and LabelEncoding
       * Repeat steps for the test dataset


#### 3. MODEL BUILDING
       * Split the dataset into train and test set
       * Train the model using the Random Forest
       * Hyperparameter Tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

#### 4. CALULATE ACCURACY
       * Find the accuracy of the model trained 
       * Find the prices for the given test_data.
## ACCURACY : 

THE ACCURACY OF THE FLIGHT FARE PREDICTION MODEL IS 81.23 %
